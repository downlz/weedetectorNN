# weedetectorNN

This repo is a working model of 2 layer neural network to classify plants.

The Dataset is from Kaggle "weed-detection-in-soybean-crops"

Steps:
1. Import Kaggle dataset
2. Load images to dataset using opencv
3. Show Images
4. Create a neural network from scratch along with predict method
5. Predict a plant based on train data
6. Display Actual vs Predicted Image

This is a minor tweak over a kaggle notebook available at <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datduyn/2-layer-net-on-weeds-discriminant/>Go to Kaggle</a>
